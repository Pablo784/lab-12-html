In my home page, I would like to have a welcome banner that catches the attention of whoever visits it. I would like to have some pictures in my home page to make my site more user-friendly. Since its my home page, I would like something simple but cool at the same time and I would like to have tabs so those who visit the site can navigate from each page with just one click. My home page will consist of a small description of what the website will be about so those who visit have an idea. My Home Page will have a clean look but something cool in it like a gif or something. 

In any site, the home page is the first thing that will pop up when you visit the site. Home Pages are the starting point of any site that we visit in our day-to-day lives and it should be something that should be eye grasping to the user.  Home Pages might sound like something simple but rather's its essential for any webiste to have one. All Home Pages are different from each other but they have one thing in commmon; giving those who visit a meanigful experience. Home Pages are the basics in a webiste & it can be whatever you want to be.
