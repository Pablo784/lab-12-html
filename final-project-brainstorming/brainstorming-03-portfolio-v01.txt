In the portfolio page, I will talk about anything that I've done up until this point. I could show graduation pictures from each level like elementary, middle, and high school. I could also put some videos of the physical computing work that I've done for MTEC 1005 using the Arduino Text Editor. I could also show some of the awards I've gotten throughout the years. In my life, I've done so many things and accomplished many things so this website is a chance to show off my accomplishments. 


Portfolios are a chance to show off what you have whether it's a physical one or a conceptual one. In finance, you have a portfolio to show what you have like stocks,bonds, etc. Back in high school I had to do a portfolio interview to show what I have learned throughout the semester. So, the same concept is applied here but the only difference here is things we have completed in the past. Basically, in my portfolio page I will includes things I have completed in the past or in the recent months; it won't matter if it's something that happend a while ago or a long time ago; I will include something in my portfolio whatever that may be because I know it's something that I'm proud of and it's worthy to be digitally displayed.
