In the about me page which will be about me I will talk about different things relating to myself. I would talk about my academic timeline; in other words I would talk about how I got to where I am now in my academic career. I would put a picture of the school and for what years I was in that school. I would do this all the way until High School since that is the recent level of graduation I have as of now. The about me page is really putting myself onto a screen; metaphorically speaking. 


The about me page I'm going to put myself in that page and try to connect with the user in some way. To start, I'll talk about my work experience in which I have some off. In the summer of 2019 I was apart of this program called Summer Youth Employment program or SYEP for short and for 2 months and a half I believe. We did things like learn about stop motion,how to use iMovie, teach the summer camp kids about stop motion, learned how to use GarageBand and taught the summer camp kids how to use GarageBand, how to use a SLR camera. I also saw how to edited a movie using Adobe Premire and the icing on the cake for me was going to Coney Island for the first time because I never been and I got to go and enjoy some ride but I had to montior the Summer Camp Kids while I was at it. Goals that I have for right now is to Graduate from College since this is last step in my academic career that I must go through to know that all of those years of going to school and getting an education was worth it.
